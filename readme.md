First of all: this project is for study porposes and I did not think most (if any) of it's source code.

GanSO is a very simple Operating System in development with no intent to be actually useful (for now).
The name is just a word play in portuguese: ganso translates to goose, and
SO (Sistema Operacional) to OS (Operating System).

I intend to follow Philipp Oppermann's tutorial, you can find it in the link down below:
https://os.phil-opp.com/

Also the source code of his project can be found at https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os


That being said, I also want to clarify it's my first time using git at all, and I'm kind self teaching me 
so if you have any thoughtful suggestion, commentary or found an issue, I'll be happy to read.

It's also my first time programming in Rust (except for hello world), and first time tackling an OS project,
 so there might be (alot of) mistakes in the comment lines and in the project as whole
 as I try to search and understand both subjects.


This OS project is currently unfinished and I have no forecast at all about it's ending.
And thanks for reading it, you're an awesome person, have a good day/night.
